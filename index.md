## My short notes 

- Activate github pages like you normally would.
- Github creates an index.md file with this content you may see below, it' is however set to a seperate branch, ie the gh-pages branch. I don't know why this is how they do it, it was confusing for me, I think they should at least have explained it and made it explicit that they did it that way.
- If you like, merge the branc to master/main and change the source.

This is very dissapointing. It turns out that somehow github messes up the new "branch" and don't have shared history with the main branch, so you cant merge in web interface. You actually have to pull down the branch, do a soft reset or somehing, then go to main branch and stage and committ the new files from the gh-pages branch, alternatively I assume you may cherry pick or smtn... Well, I'm on web only today and acutally have to copy content to new files in main, then kill gh-pages branch, jeshz...

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/codelaxx/githubpagesjekyllpoc/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
